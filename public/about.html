<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Software Engineer that has worked mostly embedded SW until now,
  that I'm starting to learn some Web Development, b/c it is necessary for
  this next project to be able to configure our AHMS module for the next
  Aircraft we are working on.

<p>I was born in West Germany and moved to Wisconsin with my parents at the
  age of 6.  There I spent my school years helping out on my parent's farm
  and learning to become handy, hardworking and how to make electricity work
  for me in wiring up simple things like outlet, lights and other things.  My
  interest in electricity and computers morphed into an Electrical Engineering
  degree at Cedarville College and later into a career in Embedded Software in 
  the Automotive and later in the Aviation industries.</p>

<p>Even since I got a tour of a Lufthansa 747 cockpit at age 8 over the Atlantic
  Ocean, I have had a strong desire to fly and work on aircraft.  I eventually
  got a Private Pilot certificate and later a job working on Flight Management
  Systems to fulfill some of my love for Aviation.  I would love to continue
  my Aviation journey by getting my Instrument, Commercial and Instructors
  certificates to use them in a way that can help people and further the Kingdom
  of Christ.</p>
